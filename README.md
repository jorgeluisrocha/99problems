# 99 Problems (but OCaml ain't one)

## Intro

The idea behind this repository is to essentially deepen my understanding
of OCaml, and by extension functional programming, by going through all of 
the famous 99 problems. Perhaps, this repo will expand to include the 
solutions in other languages: Haskell, Python, Javascript (?).

## Approach

Each solution will be in its own individual file.
